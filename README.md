A simple hangman game made in python using https://github.com/Xethron/Hangman/blob/master/words.txt as a words source, you can use your own word source by replacing the words.txt file with your text file with words. Each word should have its own line. If you use your own words, please run the "validate words.py" file afterwards. (This will remove any invalid data that could cause an error when the program is ran)
